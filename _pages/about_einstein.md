I am a 3rd year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). I am also an undergraduate researcher at the Language Understanding and Knowledge Aquisition Lab ([LUKA](https://luka-group.github.io)), where I am fortunate to be co-advised by Professors [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) and [Zhe Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/zhezhao).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
