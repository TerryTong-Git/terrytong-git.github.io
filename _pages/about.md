I am a 3rd year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). I am also an undergraduate researcher at the Language Understanding and Knowledge Aquisition Lab ([LUKA](https://luka-group.github.io)), where I am fortunate to be co-advised by Professors [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) and [Zhe Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/zhezhao). Recently, I am also lucky to work closely with Professor [Anshuman Chaabra](https://www.anshumanc.com). My work is supported by an [Undergraduate Provost Fellowship](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/PUF). I am also involved in the [Amazon Trustworthy AI Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/trusted-ai-challenge).

My research interests are in data-centric machine learning for natural language processing. Previously, I have worked on data-centric security vulnerabilties to LLMs, and am now focusing on data selection for LLMs.
